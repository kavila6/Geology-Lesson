a "{cps=35}The planet Earth can be divided into different layers{/cps}"
a "{cps=35}Imagine when you cut up an egg into half, you can see distinct layers.{/cps}"

a "{cps=35}Like the shell in an egg, the crust is the outermost and thinnest layer of the Earth where we live on.{/cps}"
a "{cps=35}The mantle underneath the crust consists of melted rocks and is the source of magma{/cps}"
a "{cps=35}which is the substance that erupts out from volcanoes.{/cps}"
a "{cps=35}Then, the core is made out of iron alloy that consists of two parts{/cps}"
